While we figure out what this should do, here are other ways
you can show your appreciations to other Pythonistas:

- Send them a [Happiness Packets](https://www.happinesspackets.io/)
- Support their work by sponsoring them on GitHub or Patreon
- Say thanks in person if you meet them at events/conferences
